# Recogs — working rules for coding agents

Native macOS + iOS SwiftUI app for managing a personal record collection via the Discogs API.

## Ground rules

Shared by `recogs`, `time-strip` and `pdf-unpack`. Where a repo-specific section below
contradicts a rule here, the repo-specific rule wins — and say so when you notice it.

- **One toolchain.** macOS 26+ (iOS 26+ where there is an iOS target), Swift 6 language mode,
  Xcode 27. CI pins the same Xcode, so code that builds locally must build there too.
- **XcodeGen owns the project.** `project.yml` is the source of truth. Never hand-edit the
  generated `.xcodeproj`. Never commit it, `Config/*.plist` or `Config/*.entitlements`. Run
  `make generate` after every `project.yml` change.
- **The Makefile is the entry point.** Run `make` to list targets. Prefer `make test` and
  `make build` over hand-written `xcodebuild` lines; the Makefile carries the flags that work.
- **No third-party runtime dependencies.** Apple frameworks only. Build tooling (XcodeGen,
  anything under `tools/`) is exempt because it does not ship. If you believe a runtime
  dependency is needed, stop and ask.
- **Logic lives in the `*Kit` framework.** `Sources/Kit` is UI-free and holds the testable
  core — no `SwiftUI`, `AppKit`, `UIKit` or `WidgetKit` imports there. App and extension
  targets stay thin.
- **Tests run offline, unsigned and unhosted.** They need no network, credentials or signing.
  A test that needs any of those belongs somewhere else.
- **Secrets never enter the repo.** No tokens, keys or Team IDs in tracked files. Each repo
  states where its own secrets live.
- **Signing reads `.env`.** Set `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` in `.env` (copy `.env.example`).
  `make generate` projects it into the git-ignored `Config/Local.xcconfig`, which
  `Config/Base.xcconfig` includes, so `xcodebuild` and ⌘R sign with the same team. Never pass
  the team on the command line or commit it.
- **One slug per app.** Lowercase the app name and turn spaces into hyphens (`PDF Unpack` →
  `pdf-unpack`). The slug is the repo name, the App Store Connect SKU, and the last part of the
  bundle ID, `com.mlkshkvch.<slug>`; other targets append to it (`…<slug>.kit`). The bundle ID
  and SKU are permanent once a build is uploaded.
- **One word per concept.** The Terminology section is binding for UI strings, code
  identifiers and docs alike. Do not introduce synonyms for variety.

## Stack

- SwiftUI multiplatform, macOS and iOS. One shared feature layer;
  platform-specific code only where the platforms genuinely differ.
- `DiscogsKit`: local Swift package (URLSession + async/await, Codable models, header-aware
  rate limiter). `swift test --package-path DiscogsKit` runs its suite.
- `RecogsKit` (`Sources/Kit`): SwiftData cache, image cache, services, and the SwiftUI feature
  layer. The views live here too, so only `AppServices` and the root view need to be public and
  the tests can run unhosted.
- SwiftData for the metadata cache; on-disk image cache. No backend, no iCloud.

## Discogs API

- Base `https://api.discogs.com`. Auth: Personal Access Token — `Authorization: Discogs token=<PAT>`.
- Required `User-Agent: Recogs/1.0 +<contact>`; generic agents get throttled harder.
- Rate limit: 60 req/min authenticated. Route every request through one central throttle that
  reads the `X-Discogs-Ratelimit*` headers, keeps a safety margin, and backs off on 429.
- Cover art is exempt: the image CDN returns no rate-limit headers and does not consume the
  budget, so images are bounded by their own concurrency cap instead.
- A copy you own is an **instance** (`instance_id`) of a `release_id` in a `folder_id`. The
  remove flow keys off `instance_id`, not `release_id`.
- **The API Terms of Use require two notices.** The affiliation notice
  (`DiscogsNotice.affiliation`) appears in Settings ▸ About, on the setup screen and in the
  README. `DiscogsCredit` ("Data provided by Discogs.") sits next to every view of Discogs data
  and links to the discogs.com page that holds it. A new screen of Discogs data needs its own
  credit.

## Terminology

- **Record** — an item in the collection. Counts, empty states, `Add Record`.
- **Release** — the edition on Discogs. Search and the add confirmation.
- **Copy** — the instance the user owns. Removal flows.

Never "pressing": the app holds CDs as well as vinyl. Never "album": wrong for the singles and
EPs Discogs is full of. The label/catalogue/country block on the record page is **Edition**.

## Caching

- **Nothing shown may be more than six hours older than Discogs** (API Terms of Use; covers
  count too). `Freshness.maximumAge` is the one constant. The collection re-syncs when it passes
  that age, a record detail is fetched again, and the sync drops any image whose URL changed.
  Offline, the cache stays on screen with its age in the status line.
- Cache images on disk, keyed by release id and size. The grid and the record page both draw
  `cover_image` (600px, quality 90); the 150px thumb is a fallback and a row icon. A file is
  fetched again only when its URL changes, never because it is old.
- SwiftData holds every collection item so the collection is browsable offline.
- Cover art lives in Application Support, not Caches, so the system cannot evict it.

## Secrets

The Discogs PAT lives in `.env` (git-ignored) for local testing only, and in the Keychain in
the shipping app. Never hard-code it, never log it, never add it as a release fallback, never
commit `.env`.

## Housekeeping

- **A green build does not prove the change shipped.** A changed default argument in
  `DiscogsKit` rebuilds the package but not its callers, because the default is materialised at
  the call site. Verify the installed binary with `Scripts/verify-installed.sh <udid>`.
- **Inspect simulator state instead of guessing** — read the app's store and defaults from the
  simulator container.
- **Check app icons by rendering them.** macOS 26 masks this app's full-bleed square icon, and
  it draws a pre-masked icon on Apple's 824-on-1024 grid as-is, so both render correctly. Before
  changing icon assets, render `NSWorkspace.shared.icon(forFile:)` for the built app and compare.
  `assets/icon.png` for the README is masked by hand — GitHub shows a PNG as-is.
- **`PRIVACY.md` has a fixed URL.** App Store Connect, Help ▸ Privacy Policy, Settings ▸ About
  and the setup screen point at `github.com/lysyi3m/recogs/blob/master/PRIVACY.md`
  (`AppLinks.privacyPolicy`). Never move or rename it, and keep its claims true of the code.
- **Privacy manifest keys are unvalidated.** `plutil` and Xcode accept a wrong key silently.
  Check `Config/PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` against Apple's documentation, not against a clean build.
- `LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` carries a macOS-specific variant in `project.yml`. XcodeGen emits
  only the iOS rpath for a multiplatform target, and a macOS executable sits one level deeper.
  Removing it makes the app abort at launch on `@rpath/RecogsKit.framework`.
